###Enhancements

The artifact I have chosen to showcase all three of my enhancements is the Destination Slideshow created in CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle. This application was a simple Java slideshow that made use of HTML to display small slides in a desktop application. I saw the potential to make this slideshow into a modern, scalable, and secure web application that would demonstrate my skills in all three major enhancement categories: Software Design, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases.
